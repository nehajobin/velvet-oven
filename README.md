Velvet Oven is a vintage-inspired arcade game where you play as a hippie girl on a mission to catch as many cakes as possible! With pixel-art charm and groovy vibes, cakes fall randomly from the top of the screen and it’s your job to move fast and grab them all. 
Can you catch all 25 before they hit the ground?
🚀 How to Play
-----------------
Press SPACE to start the game.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the girl.
Catch all 25 cakes as they fall!
Score is shown in real-time (e.g. 13/25).
Finish with a fun message depending on your score:
    🎉 “Yeah! You got all the cakes!”
    😬 “Oops! You got 17/25 cakes.”
